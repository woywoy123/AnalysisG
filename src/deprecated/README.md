# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains documentation files that were previously scattered throughout the src directory.

These files have been moved here as part of the documentation restructuring to use Doxygen (.dox files) for code documentation.

## Files in this folder:

- `particles_bsm_4tops.rst` - Original RST documentation from events/bsm_4tops
- `eventtemplate.md` - Template documentation for events
- `modeltemplate.md` - Template documentation for models
- `selectiontemplate.md` - Template documentation for selections
- `graphtemplate.md` - Template documentation for graphs
- `particletemplate.md` - Template documentation for particles

The content from these files should be integrated into the new Doxygen-based documentation system.

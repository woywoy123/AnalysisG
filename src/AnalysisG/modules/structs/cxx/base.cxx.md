# Documentation for base.cxx

## Overview
This file contains core functionality for the base structure class (`bsc_t`) which appears to be part of a data processing framework. The file includes methods for type translation, string conversion, buffer manipulation, and utility functions.

## Function Documentation

### `void buildDict(std::string _name, std::string _shrt)`
Builds a dictionary mapping between full names and shortened versions. This appears to be used for data structure mapping or alias creation.

### `void registerInclude(std::string pth, bool is_abs)`
Registers include paths for the system. The `is_abs` parameter indicates whether the path is absolute or relative.

### `void buildPCM(std::string name, std::string incl, bool exl)`
Builds a Precompiled Module (PCM) with the given name, include path, and exclusion flag.

### `void buildAll()`
Initializes and builds all required components. This is likely a convenience function to set up the entire system.

### `bsc_t::bsc_t()` and `bsc_t::~bsc_t()`
Constructor and destructor for the base structure class.

### `int count(const std::string* str, const std::string sub)`
Utility function to count occurrences of a substring within a string.

### `data_enum bsc_t::root_type_translate(std::string* root_str)`
Translates a string representation of a type to the corresponding enumeration value. Part of the routing system that maps string identifiers to internal data types.

### `std::string bsc_t::as_string()`
Converts the current object to a string representation.

### `std::string bsc_t::scan_buffer()`
Scans and processes the internal buffer, returning a string result.

### `void bsc_t::flush_buffer()`
Clears the internal buffer, resetting it to its initial state.

## Code Organization Notes

The file contains important markers for code organization:
1. "Add your type" section (marker 2)
2. "Add the routing" section (marker 3)
3. "Add the buffer flush" section (marker 4)

These markers suggest that the code is meant to be extended at these specific points.

ChildrenKinematics
------------------

A set of studies relating to the decay children of truth-tops.
These studies aim to investigate the kinematics of the decay products from resonance tops and compare these to background spectator tops.
For these studies, the invariant mass of the injected resonance is varied from 400 - 1000 GeV.

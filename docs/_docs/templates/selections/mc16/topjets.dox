 * @brief Implements the core analysis logic for the topjets selection.

 *
 * @details
 * The strategy involves several steps:
 * 1.  **Basic Truth Top to Truth Jet Matching:**
 *     - Iterates through each truth top in the event.
 *     - Identifies the truth jets associated with the top.
 *     - Handles cases where a top is not matched to any jets (lost tops).
 *     - Includes leptonic decay products if present.
 *     - Calculates the invariant mass of the matched jets (`top_mass`).
 *     - Counts the number of jets matched to the top (`n_jets`).
 *     - Determines how many distinct tops share the same matched jets (`n_tops`).
 *     - Stores the calculated `top_mass` categorized by decay mode (leptonic/hadronic),
 *       number of matched jets, and number of shared tops in the `top_mass` map.
 *     - Records the number of lost tops per event in `ntops_lost`.
 *
 * 2.  **Kinematic Studies:**
 *     - Iterates through each truth top again.
 *     - Categorizes the top based on its origin (resonant/spectator) and decay mode (leptonic/hadronic).
 *     - For each pair of jets associated with the same top:
 *       - Calculates the DeltaR separation between the jets.
 *       - Records the top's energy and Pt.
 *       - Stores these values in the `jet_top` map, categorized by the combined mode string.
 *     - For each jet associated with the top:
 *       - Calculates the DeltaR separation between this jet and any other jet in the event *not* associated with the *same* top (considered background).
 *       - Stores this DeltaR in the `jet_top` map under the "background" category.
 *     - For each parton associated with a jet matched to the top:
 *       - Determines the parton's symbol (or "null" if undefined).
 *       - Calculates the DeltaR between the parton and its parent jet.
 *       - Records the Pt and energy of the top, the parton, and the jet.
 *       - Stores these kinematic variables in the `jet_partons` map, categorized by the top's mode and the parton's symbol.
 *
 * 3.  **Background Parton Studies:**
 *     - Iterates through all jets in the event.
 *     - Selects jets that are *not* associated with any truth top (background jets).
 *     - For each parton associated with these background jets:
 *       - Determines the parton's symbol.
 *       - Calculates the DeltaR between the parton and the jet.
 *       - Records the Pt and energy of the parton and the jet.
 *       - Stores these values in the `jet_partons` map under the "background" category.
 *
 * 4.  **Ghost Parton Energy Contribution:**
 *     - Iterates through all jets in the event.
 *     - Identifies the unique partons associated with the jet.
 *     - Calculates the sum of the four-vectors of these partons.
 *     - Calculates the ratio of the jet's Pt and energy to the summed parton Pt and energy.
 *     - Records these ratios and the number of partons in the `jets_contribute` map.
 *     - Records the jet's mass and the number of tops it's associated with in the `jet_mass` map.
 *     - Further analysis on jets associated with tops:
 *       - Maps partons within the jet to the specific top(s) they originated from (via parentage).
 *       - Calculates the total energy of all partons associated with *any* top within the jet.
 *       - For each top associated with the jet, calculates the energy contribution of its specific partons relative to the total energy of all top-associated partons in that jet.
 *       - Stores this energy ratio in the `jets_contribute` map, categorized by the number of tops associated with the jet.

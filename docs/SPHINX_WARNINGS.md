# Sphinx Build Warnings

## Current Status

The Sphinx build completes successfully with 17 warnings. These warnings are pre-existing and not related to the Doxygen/Breathe integration.

## Warning Types

All 17 warnings are "duplicate object description" warnings from the PyC (Python CUDA) module documentation:

- **pyc/graph.rst**: Duplicate descriptions of Graph.Base, Graph.Cartesian, Graph.Polar classes and methods (8 warnings)
- **pyc/nusol.rst**: Duplicate descriptions of NuSol.Polar and NuSol.Cartesian classes (8 warnings)
- **LaTeX warning**: LaTeX command cannot be run (1 warning - imgmath_latex setting)

## Root Cause

These warnings occur because the PyC module documentation includes the same classes in multiple locations:
- Once in `pyc/main.rst` (overview)
- Again in `pyc/graph.rst` and `pyc/nusol.rst` (detailed documentation)

This is a design choice to provide both overview and detailed views of the API.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use :no-index: directive (Recommended)

Add `:no-index:` to the duplicate entries in the detailed documentation files to suppress index generation:

```rst
.. autoclass:: pyc.Graph.Base
   :no-index:
   :members:
```

### Option 2: Restructure documentation

Remove duplicates by documenting each class only once, either in the overview or the detailed section (not both).

### Option 3: Accept the warnings

Since these warnings don't affect the build output quality and are informational only, they can be accepted as-is. The documentation builds successfully and is fully functional.

## Impact

- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (exit code 0)
- **Documentation Quality**: ✅ All pages generated correctly
- **User Impact**: ✅ None - warnings don't affect rendered output
- **Search Functionality**: ✅ Works correctly
- **Read the Docs**: ✅ Will build successfully

## Recommendation

These warnings are informational and can be addressed in a separate PR focused on PyC documentation restructuring. They do not block the Doxygen/Breathe integration or Read the Docs hosting.

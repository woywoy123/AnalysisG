# AnalysisG Modules

This section provides documentation for the core modules of the AnalysisG framework.

## Core Modules

AnalysisG is organized into several core modules, each responsible for specific functionality:

### Analysis Module
The central module that orchestrates the entire workflow, connecting all other modules together.

The Model Class
***************

A module which wraps the given model into a Cython compatible object.
Following the mapping procedure, the model is given additional attributes and functionality, which includes some minor adjustments to **PyTorch Geometric**.

.. py:class:: AnalysisG.Model.Model(model = None):

    :param model: A trainable model.

    .. py:function:: match_data_model_vars(Data sample) -> None

        Inspects the input sample and creates an internal map where the inputs and outputs of the model are mapped to the variables of the sample.

    .. py:function:: backward()

        Triggers the back-propagation of the learnable parameters.

    .. py:function:: save()

        Saves the current state of the model's trainable parameters.

    .. py:function:: load()

        Restores a saved training state.

    .. py:function:: __call__(data) -> dict
        
        Executes the model on the input data and outputs a dictionary with the following keys:
        
        - **L_***: The loss associated with the particular output of the model.
        - **A_***: The accuracy associated with the model's prediction (if it is of classification type).
        - **total**: The total loss of the all the model outputs :math:`\mathcal{L}_{total} = \Sigma_{i} \mathcal{L} _i`
        - **graphs**: 
          Unpacks a batched data element with the output of the model's output. 
          The unpacking is a hacked method of the **to_data_list()** method of **PyGeometric**.

    :ivar dict __param__: 
        A free parameter dictionary used to initialize the model with. 
        This parameter relevant if the model has input parameters during the __init__ call.
    
    :ivar bool train: Sets the model to training mode.
    :ivar dict in_map: A mapping of the model's input parameters and the training sample.
    :ivar dict out_map: A mapping of the model's output parameters to the truth training sample attributes.
    :ivar dict loss_map: Returns the loss of each model output.
    :ivar dict class_map: A map indicating which of the model's output are used for classification modes.
    :ivar Code code: Returns a **Code** object to rebuild the model object.
    :ivar int Epoch: The epoch of the trained model.
    :ivar int KFold: The kFold of the trained model.
    :ivar str Path: The path of the model's saved state.
    :ivar str RunName: The run-name of the model.
    :ivar model: Returns the original model type.
    :ivar str device: The device that the model should be transferred to.
    :ivar bool failure: Indicates whether the model's code was not properly traced or initialized.
    :ivar str error_message: Returns the error associated with the model.

Model Declarations (Example)
============================

The Model wrapper class was introduced to do a preliminary scan of the model's inputs and prevent the model from crashing during training, due to features missing. 
To further improve performance of the inference and training of a given model, the internal mapping only provides the model with the inputs it requires rather than injecting all features. 
To declare a specific input parameter, the pre-fixes **G**, **N** and **E** are used to indicate whether a Graph, Node or Edge feature is requested.
A similar syntax is used to request truth features as inputs, by appending to the pre-fixes, **_T**.

MC 16 Simulation Truth Matching
===============================

This section of the studies is dedicated to understanding whether the truth matching to tops is consistent.
Studies are detailed below and with their respective figures being listed for each study.
To reproduce these studies, samples need to be generated using an AnalysisTop based codebase, which is linked below:

Studies
-------

* ZPrime:
  A study which investigates the resolution of the injected resonance for different mass points using decreasing truth information.
  The injected resonance mass is varied from 400 GeV to 1000 GeV (1 TeV), and the truth information is changed from truth-tops (perfect resolution) to detector jets (worst resoluton).
  For the truth-jets, the truth neutrinos and leptons are used, if the tops decay leptonically.
  As for the jets case, the truth neutrinos and detector leptons are used.

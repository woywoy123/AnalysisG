A study which investigates the resolution of the injected resonance for different mass points using decreasing truth information.
The injected resonance mass is varied from 400 GeV to 1000 GeV (1 TeV), and the truth information is changed from truth-tops (perfect resolution) to detector jets (worst resolution).
For the truth-jets, the truth neutrinos and leptons are used, if the tops decay leptonically.
As for the jets case, the truth neutrinos and detector leptons are used. 

* Figure.1.a: 
  A matrix plot of the resonance using the truth-tops as input particles.
  The resonance mass points should be visible as distinct vertical lines since the truth tops have not undergone any detector smearing.

* Figure.1.b:
  A matrix plot of the resonance using the top-children as input particles.
  The resonance mass points should still be visible as distinct vertical lines, however some smearing is expected, since top-children undergo gluon radiation and the W-boson might emit a photon. 

* Figure.1.c:
  A matrix plot of the resonance using the truth-jets and truth-children (leptons and neutrinos only) as input particles.
  The resonance mass points should still be visible but each mass point might be overlapping due to initial detector smearing effects and track clustering when building truth-jets.

* Figure.1.d: 
  A matrix plot of the resonance using the jets, detector leptons and truth-children (neutrinos only) as input particles.
  The resonance mass points might be visible but each mass point might be overlapping due to detector smearing effects and track clustering when building jets.

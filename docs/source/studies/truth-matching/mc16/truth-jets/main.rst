TopTruthJets
============

A set of studies involving the truth matching performance of truth jets and truth children (if the originating top is leptonic). 
The aim is to investigate the resolution of the formed invariant top-mass when using the truth jet container, followed by their respective kinematics and parton content.

Figure 7.a

   :name: Figure.7.a

   The figure illustrates the formed invariant mass of the top-quark from truth jets being matched to individual tops by index.
   The underlying distribution is partitioned into whether a given top has decayed leptonically or hadronically.
   For leptonically decaying tops, truth children (lepton and neutrino) are used from the associated parent top.

   For background entries, the other truth jet is not allowed to originate from the same Top-Quark however, the other Truth-Jet can also originate from a different Top-Quark.

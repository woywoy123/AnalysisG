TopMatching
===========

Studies relating to the truth matching scheme being used to assign reconstructed detector physics objects to individual top quarks (from truth).
The aim is to investigate the best possible top reconstructibility available at different truth levels.
Investigated levels involve the truth-top, truth-children, truth-jets with truth leptons/neutrinos, jets with truth leptons/neutrinos and jets with detector matched leptons and truth truth neutrinos.

* Figure.4.a:
  A figure depicting the top-quark invariant mass reconstruction, from the proposed truth matching scheme at different truth levels.
  The figure should illustrate a perfect peak at 172 GeV (truth-tops), with worsening resolution as more truth information is removed from the matching.
  The worst resolution is expected to be detector jets matched with detector leptons.

* Figure.4.b:
  A figure depicting the top-quark invariant mass reconstruction from truth children.
  The overall distribution is partitioned into the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the tops.

* Figure.4.c:
  A figure depicting the top-quark invariant mass reconstruction from truth jets using the truth children, when the top-quark decayed leptonically.
  The overall distribution is partitioned into the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the tops.

* Figure.4.d:
  A figure depicting the top-quark invariant mass reconstruction from jets using the truth children, when the top-quark decayed leptonically.
  The overall distribution is partitioned into the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the tops.

* Figure.4.e:
  A figure depicting the top-quark invariant mass reconstruction from jets and matched detector leptons, when the top-quark decay leptonically only truth neutrinos are used.
  The overall distribution is partitioned into the hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the tops.

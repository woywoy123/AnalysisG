Studies
_______

* Truth Tops: 
  This study produces plots specifically relating to post-final-state-radiation top quarks.
  Plots produced aim to check for consistency in kinematics and possible resonance signatures, which could be potentially found by combining two tops and computing the invariant mass (Mtt).


Truth Tops
__________

* Figure.1.a: 
  A plot showing the invariant truth-top mass.
  The expectation of this plot is to have a single-binned top-mass bin at around 172 GeV (i.e. the top mass).

* Figure.1.b: 
  A plot of the :math:`\Delta` R between two top-quarks. 
  No explicit expectations for this plot are expected, however, there might be a peak if the top-quark pairs originate from a common scalar/vector intermediate resonance.
  Using a 1.25 TeV sample Z prime sample, does produce a peak at around 3.0, which needs to be compared to background Standard Model 4 top quark production.

* Figure.1.c:
  A plot illustrating the invariant mass of combining two top-quarks to produce a potential Z-prime resonance. 
  The algorithm used simply permutes through all possible top pairs and computes the invariant mass.
  From initial 1.25 TeV Z-Prime samples, no peak was visible from this distribution. 

* Figure.1.d: A plot showing the transverse momenta distribution of individual top-quarks.
* Figure.1.e: A plot showing the pseudo-rapidity (:math:`\eta`) of individual top-quarks.
* Figure.1.f: A plot showing the azimuthal distribution of individual top-quarks.
* Figure.1.g: A plot showing the pseudo-rapidity (:math:`\eta`) of individual top-quarks.
* Figure.1.h: 
  A plot showing the electric charge of individual top-quarks. 
  For a Z-prime signal sample, the number of negatively charged tops should be the same as positively charged ones.
* Figure.1.i: A plot showing the barcodes of the tops. 
* Figure.1.j: 
  A plot of the top status codes.
  From initial runs, a single status code was found (62).
* Figure.1.k: 
  A consistency test plot, which counts the number of tops in each event.
  For 4-top samples, a single bin should be filled.

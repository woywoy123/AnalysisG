Decay Modes Studies
-------------------

A set of studies investigating the decay modes of tops with an injected resonance at various mass points.
The aim is to understand the decay modes of the tops and if there are any discriminating variables, which could be useful for identifying signal events.

Selection Requirement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For events to be considered in this study, the event needs to satisfy the following requirements:

- Exactly two tops marked originating from resonance
- Exactly two tops marked *NOT* originating from resonance 


Figures Relating to the Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_4a`)
A collection of invariant mass figures segmenting the underlying distributions into the decay mode of the resonance tops. 

:ref:`figure_4b`)
A collection of normalized fractional plots of the PDGID codes from tops decaying into their respective children. 
The plots are segmented by resonance and spectator top decay.

:ref:`figure_4c`)
A collection of invariant mass distributions of the resonance whereby one top decays leptonically and the other hadronically.

Truth Study: DecayModes
-----------------------

A set of studies which investigates the decay modes of the resonant and spectator tops originating from a resonance. 
The aim is to understand the decay modes of the tops and if there are any discriminating variables, which could be useful for identifying signal events.

Selection Requirement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For events to be considered in this study, the event needs to satisfy the following requirements:

- Exactly two tops marked originating from resonance
- Exactly two tops marked *NOT* originating from resonance

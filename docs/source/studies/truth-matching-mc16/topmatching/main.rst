TopMatching
-----------

Studies relating to the truth matching scheme being used to assign reconstructed detector physics objects to individual top quarks (from truth).
The aim is to investigate the best possible top reconstructibility available at different truth levels.
Investigated levels involve the truth-top, truth-children, truth-jets with truth leptons/neutrinos, jets with truth leptons/neutrinos and jets with detector matched leptons and truth truth neutrinos.

Figures Relating to Studies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_2a`)  
A collection of figures showing the invariant mass distributions of matched tops using various levels of truth information.
The level of truth ranges from computing the invariant mass of the original top parton (expected to be around 172.68) to purely detector based objects (with the expection of neutrinos from leptonically decaying tops).

:ref:`figure_2b`)
A collection of figures illustrating the invariant mass of mutually matched tops using the **children**.

:ref:`figure_2c`)
A collection of figures illustrating the invariant mass of mutually matched tops to **truth jets**
For cases where the tops decay leptonically, the children lepton and neutrino were used.

:ref:`figure_2d`)
A collection of figures illustrating the invariant mass of mutually matched tops to detector **jets**
For cases where the tops decay leptonically, the children lepton and neutrino were used.

:ref:`figure_2e`)
A collection of figures illustrating the invariant mass of mutually matched tops to detector **jets and leptons**
For cases where the tops decay leptonically, the **neutrino was sourced from the children**.

:ref:`figure_2f`)
Figures depicting the underlying number of **truth jets** being matched to a mutual top, where the top has been identified to be decaying **leptonically**.
For these figures, the respective **lepton and neutrino was sourced from the children**.

:ref:`figure_2g`)
Figures depicting the underlying number of **truth jets** being matched to a mutual top, where the top has been identified to be decaying **hadronically**.

:ref:`figure_2h`)
Figures depicting the underlying number of **jets** being matched to a mutual top, where the top has been identified to be decaying **leptonically**.
For these figures, the respective **neutrino was sourced from the children** and the charged lepton from the detector.

:ref:`figure_2i`)
Figures depicting the underlying number of **jets** being matched to a mutual top, where the top has been identified to be decaying **hadronically**.

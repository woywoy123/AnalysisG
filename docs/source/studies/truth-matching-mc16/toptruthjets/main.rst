Top Truth Jets
--------------

A set of studies involving the truth matching performance of truth jets and truth children (if the originating top is leptonic). 
The aim is to investigate the resolution of the formed invariant top-mass when using the truth jet container, followed by their respective kinematics and parton content.

Figures Relating to the Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_5a`)
A collection of normalized invariant mass distributions of truth jets being matched to truth tops. 
Figures are segmented into whether the matched top decays leptonically or hadronically.
For leptonic tops, the truth lepton and neutrinos are used (based on the truth children of the top).

:ref:`figure_5b`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions for n-truth jet contributions involving **leptonically decaying tops**.

:ref:`figure_5c`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions for n-truth jet contributions involving **hadronically decaying tops**.

:ref:`figure_5d`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions using truth jets, where **several tops share a truth jet in the leptonic channel**.

:ref:`figure_5e`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions using truth jets, where **several tops share a truth jet in the hadronic channel**.

:ref:`figure_5f`)
The :math:`\Delta` R between truth jets matched to mutual tops compared to other background truth jets.
These distributions are normalized and segmented by whether the mutual top is resonant (leptonic/hadronic) or spectator (leptonic/hadronic).

:ref:`figure_5o`)
A collection of stacked distributions illustrating the :math:`\Delta` R between the truth jet axis and ghost matched partons.
The underlying distributions are segmented by whether the ghost parton is a light-quark, b-quark or gluon.

Truth Study: TopKinematics
--------------------------

Studies relating to the kinematics of the tops produced from the resonance and their corresponding spectator counterparts.
The given figures below have been produced for various mass points of the heavy resonance and are therefore bunched together per-figure link.


Figures Relating to the Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_1a`)
A collection of figures depicting the **transverse momenta** distributions for spectator and resonance tops with various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_1b`)
A collection of figures depicting the **energy** distributions for spectator and resonance tops with various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_1c`)
A collection of figures depicting the **azimuthal** distributions for spectator and resonance tops with various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_1d`)
Figures depicting the azimuthal angular distribution of spectator and resonant tops.

:ref:`figure_1e`)
Figures showing two dimensional heat-maps of energy against transverse momenta for **resonant** tops.

:ref:`figure_1f`)
Figures showing two dimensional heat-maps of energy against transverse momenta for **spectator** tops.

:ref:`figure_1g`)
Distribution plots of the :math:`\Delta R` between truth-top pairs.
For plots with Resonance and Spectator titles, top-pairs are correctly assigned, otherwise they are labelled as a Mixture.

:ref:`figure_1h`)
Distribution plots of the invariant mass produced when combining truth-top pairs.
For plots with Resonance and Spectator titles, top-pairs are correctly assigned, otherwise they are labelled as a Mixture.

:ref:`figure_1i`)
A two dimensional head-map of the invariant mass as a function of :math:`\Delta R`.
For this plot, all possible truth-top pair permutations are used to compute the invariant mass and the :math:`\Delta R`.

Top Jets
--------

A set of studies involving the truth matching performance of jets and truth children (if the originating top is leptonic). 
The aim is to investigate the resolution of the formed invariant top-mass when using the jet container, followed by their respective kinematics and parton content.

Figures Relating to the Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_7a`)
A collection of normalized invariant mass distributions of jets being matched to truth tops. 
Figures are segmented into whether the matched top decays leptonically or hadronically.
For leptonic tops, the truth lepton and neutrinos are used (based on the truth children of the top).

:ref:`figure_7b`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions for n-jet contributions involving **leptonically decaying tops**.

:ref:`figure_7c`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions for n-jet contributions involving **hadronically decaying tops**.

:ref:`figure_7d`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions using jets, where **several tops share a jet in the leptonic channel**.

:ref:`figure_7e`)
A collection of normalized invariant top mass distributions using jets, where **several tops share a jet in the hadronic channel**.

:ref:`figure_7f`)
The :math:`\Delta` R between jets matched to mutual tops compared to other background jets.
These distributions are normalized and segmented by whether the mutual top is resonant (leptonic/hadronic) or spectator (leptonic/hadronic).

:ref:`figure_7k`)
A two dimensional heat map of the observed :math:`\Delta` R between mutual tops as a function of the matched **top's transverse momentum (resonance leptonic)**.

:ref:`figure_7l`)
A two dimensional heat map of the observed :math:`\Delta` R between mutual tops as a function of the matched **top's transverse momentum (resonance hadronic)**.

:ref:`figure_7o`)
A collection of stacked distributions illustrating the :math:`\Delta` R between the jet axis and ghost matched partons.
The underlying distributions are segmented by whether the ghost parton is a light-quark, b-quark or gluon.

The :math:`\Delta` R between the jet axis and ghost matched partons for **leptonically decaying resonance tops**.

:ref:`figure_7s`)
The :math:`\Delta` R between the jet axis and ghost matched partons for **hadronically decaying resonance tops**.

:ref:`figure_7t`)
The :math:`\Delta` R between the jet axis and ghost matched partons for **leptonically decaying spectator tops**.

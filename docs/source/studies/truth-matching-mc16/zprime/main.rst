Resonance ZPrime Studies
------------------------

This collection of studies aims to illustrate the shape of the target resonance at multiple mass points and how the shape resolution degrades with removing truth information.
Initially, only truth tops are used to construct the resonance's invariant mass, this is followed by replacing truth tops with the decay products of said tops.
Subsequently, (truth)-jets are matched to children to construct the resonance invariant mass.

A figure illustrating the resonance mass distributions using truth tops.

A figure illustrating the resonance mass distributions using the children partons of the tops.

:ref:`figure_6c`)
A figure illustrating the resonance mass distributions using a mixture of truth jets and children.
In the case of the children, only the associated leptons are used (neutrinos and charged leptons).

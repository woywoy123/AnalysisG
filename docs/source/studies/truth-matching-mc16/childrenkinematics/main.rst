ChildrenKinematics
------------------

A set of studies relating to the decay children of truth-tops.
These studies aim to investigate the kinematics of the decay products from resonance tops and compare these to background spectator tops.
For these studies, the invariant mass of the injected resonance is varied from 400 - 1000 GeV.

Figures Relating to the Study
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`figure_3a`)
A collection of normalized **transverse momentum** distributions for truth children originating either resonance and spectator tops at various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_3b`)
A collection of stacked normalized **transverse momentum** distributions using the truth children matched to a **resonant** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

:ref:`figure_3c`)
A collection of stacked normalized **transverse momentum** distributions using the truth children matched to a **spectator** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

:ref:`figure_3d`)
A collection of normalized **pseudorapidity** distributions for truth children originating either resonance and spectator tops at various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_3e`)
A collection of stacked normalized **pseudorapidity** distributions using the truth children matched to a **resonant** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

:ref:`figure_3f`)
A collection of stacked normalized **pseudorapidity** distributions using the truth children matched to a **spectator** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

:ref:`figure_3g`)
A collection of normalized **azimuthal** distributions for truth children originating either resonance and spectator tops at various injected resonance mass points.

:ref:`figure_3h`)
A collection of stacked normalized **azimuthal** distributions using the truth children matched to a **resonant** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

:ref:`figure_3i`)
A collection of stacked normalized **azimuthal** distributions using the truth children matched to a **spectator** top-quark.
The overall distribution is partitioned into whether the PDGID of the truth child is a lepton, neutrino, light quark, b-quark or rarely a photon.

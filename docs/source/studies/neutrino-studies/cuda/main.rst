Improved Performance and Algorithm Extension
============================================

This study centralizes around improving the speed of the reference algorithm and extending it.
Initally, the study compares the performance enhancement achieved using native CUDA kernels compared to the torch tensor based implementation.
Similar to previous studies, multiple validation plots are illustrated, which asserts the consistency of the native CUDA implementation.
Following a set of consistency validation studies, an extension to the algorithm is proposed and tested.

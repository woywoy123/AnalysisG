The ModelTemplate Source Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new model to the framework, navigate to the template files (src/AnalysisG/templates/model) and copy the source files into the existing model directory.
Make sure to rename the folder appropriately, and rename files with the `<model-name>` prefix as needed.
The given template files have all the needed structures in place, and essentially just require search and replace modifications.

Getting Started
===============

Using the Framework with ROOT Samples
*************************************
To make the framework compatible with your ROOT samples, create a new workspace directory. 

.. code-block:: console 

    mkdir Analysis
    mkdir Analysis/Objects

Within the **Objects** folder create the following files:

.. code-block:: console 

   touch Analysis/Objects/particles.py
   touch Analysis/Objects/event.py
   touch Analysis/Objects/graph.py
   touch Analysis/Objects/selection.py

The above directory structure does not necessarily need to be followed, but minimizes clutter and provides oversight over what the Analysis is composed of. 
Alternatively, the following bash command can be run which will mimic the above structure but, pre-populate the templates for you.

.. code-block:: console 

   make_analysis 

.. _particle-start:

Particle Definitions
********************
To create the particles templates, open the **particles.py** file and import the framework's base **ParticleTemplate** class. 
This base class interprets the attributes and additional functionalities which will be discussed further in a dedicated advanced section.
For now, a primitive example, would look like the code below: 

.. code-block:: python
    
    from AnalysisG.Templates import ParticleTemplate

    # Inherit functions from ParticleTemplate
    class CustomParticle(ParticleTemplate):

        def __init__(self):
            # Initialize the object and inherit base properties 
            ParticleTemplate.__init__(self)

            # optional but useful for making templates
            self.Type = "Particle"  

            # Define the four vector 
            self.pt = self.Type + ".pt"
            self.eta = self.Type + ".eta"
            self.phi = self.Type + ".phi"
            self.e = self.Type + ".energy"

            #.... <Some other desired attributes>

.. _event-start:

Event Definitions
*****************
To create an event implementation, simply open the **event.py** file and import the particles defined in the **particles.py** file. 
Similar to the **particle.py** case, the name of the file can be completely arbitrary. 
Within the **event.py** file, again the frameworks base class **EventTemplate** and add a few declarations, as shown below:

.. code-block:: python 

    from AnalysisG.Templates import EventTemplate
    from particles import CustomParticle

    class CustomEvent(EventTemplate):
        def __init__(self):
            EventTemplate.__init__(self)

            self.Type = "Event"
            self.runNumber = self.Type + ".Number" # <--- Example event leaf variable

            # Specify the trees you want to use for each event.
            self.Tree = ["nominal", "..."] 

            # Depending where the particles should be read from, either specify the branch 
            # or leave the branch empty and the framework will revert to the tree 
            # If there are any relevant branches add these as well.
            self.Branches = ["..."] 

            # Add particles/additional objects constituting the event
            self.Objects = {
                "ArbitraryParticleName" : CustomParticle()
            }

            # Event luminosity which is used for computing the 
            # integrated luminosity for a sum of events.
            self.weight = 1 # can be hard coded like this or assigned a string 

        def CompileEvent(self):
            # Particle names defined in self.Objects will appear 
            # in this code segment as self.<Some Random Name>.
            # For example; 
            for i in self.ArbitraryParticleName:
                print(self.ArbitraryParticleName[k].pt)

            # Convert particle dictionary to list of particles for the event.
            self.ArbitraryParticleName = list(self.ArbitraryParticleName.values())


            # ... <Some Compiler Logic - Particle Matching etc.>


Important Attributes of EventTemplate
*************************************
Unlike the **ParticleTemplate**, the **EventTemplate** contains much more logic and adjustable parameters.
Most important to note are the key attributes, **Objects**, **Tree** and **Branches**. 
The **Objects** attribute tells the framework to link these particles to the event, if this variable is not populated, the event will simply have no particles. 
The **Tree** and **Branches** variables are used to control which parts of the ROOT file, the framework should source the particles/event attributes from. 
Fortunately, if a tree or branch has not been found, a warning will be issued and the associated object attribute will be skipped. 

.. _graph-start:

Graph Definitions
*****************
Similar to the above examples, to create graph data structures simply open the **graph.py** file inherit the base **GraphTemplate** class as shown below:

.. code-block:: python 

    from AnalysisG.Templates import GraphTemplate

    class MyGraph(GraphTemplate):

        def __init__(self, Event = None):
            self.Event = Event 
            self.Particles += self.Event.ArbitraryParticleName


A question have occurred here, "where/when do I assign features to the graph?". 
The answer is during the Analysis object phase, which will be illustrated below: 

.. code-block:: python 

    from AnalysisG import Analysis 
    from Objects.event import MyEvent
    from Objects.graphs import MyGraph

    def some_edge(a, b): return a.px - b.px
    def some_node(a): return a.px
    def some_graph(ev): return ev.weight


    Ana = Analysis()
    Ana.Event = MyEvent 
    Ana.EventGraph = MyGraph 
    Ana.AddEdgeFeature(some_edge, "delta_px")
    Ana.AddNodeFeature(some_node, "px")
    Ana.AddGraphFeature(some_graph, "weight")
    Ana.Launch


There is a lot going on in the above example, this can be summarized as follows: 

- The first lines are just importing **MyEvent** and **MyGraph** 
- The second block defines the functions defining the attributes to add to the graph.
- The third block utilizes the **Analysis** module to unify all modules and provides an interface to launch the code. 

Another question might arise, "I havnt defined the attributes **.px**, does the above code work for me?", the answer is yes. 
The **ParticleTemplate** has several inbuilt functions which allow the user to seamlessly switch between coordinate systems.
Some of these attributes will be discussed under the **Advanced section**.

.. _selection-start:

Selection Definitions
*********************
This module is optional but can be very useful for post-processing ROOT samples. 
Here events can be filtered according to some event selection criteria and subsequently passed to some clustering strategy. 
For example, if the aim is to generate mass distributions of a heavy scalar resonance, a strategy method can be defined and used to sum particles together and record the associated mass.
Or alternatively, if the input ROOT samples were generated with some framework, this module can be rather useful to verify whether the matching/tagging of particles is done correctly. 

To implement a selection, open the **selection.py** and inherit the **SelectionTemplate** as shown below: 

.. code-block:: python 

    from AnaylsisG.Templates import SelectionTemplate

    class MySelection(SelectionTemplate):

        def __init__(self):
            self.ClusterMasses = {}
            self.ParticleMasses = []

        def Selection(self, event):
            if len(event.ArbitraryParticleName) == 4:
                return True
            return False

        def Strategy(self, event):
            self.ClusterMasses += [sum(event.ArbitraryParticleName).Mass]
            for i in event.ArbitraryParticleName:
                self.ParticleMasses.append(i.Mass)

In the above example, the **Selection** method is used to pre-filter events, for example if the event doesn't contain exactly 4 particles, then the event is skipped due to it not meeting the event requirements. 
Only events passing the **Selection** method will be further passed to the **Strategy** method, where additional information can be extracted.

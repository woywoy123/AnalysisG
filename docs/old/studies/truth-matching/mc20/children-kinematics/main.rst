Children-Kinematics
===================

A set of studies relating to the decay children of truth-tops.

Figure 2.a

.. figure:: ./figures/Figure.2.a.png
   :align: center
   :name: Figure.2.mc20.a

   A histogram plot of the :math:`\Delta R` between the origin truth top and associated truth children.
   The plot is partitioned into the top decay channel being either hadronic or leptonic.

Figure 2.b
----------
.. figure:: ./figures/Figure.2.b.png
   :align: center
   :name: Figure.2.mc20.b

   A histogram plot of the :math:`\Delta R` between the origin truth top and associated children for the leptonic decay mode.
   The plot is partitioned into the particle symbols.

Figure 2.c
----------
.. figure:: ./figures/Figure.2.c.png
   :align: center
   :name: Figure.2.mc20.c

   A histogram plot of the :math:`\Delta R` between the origin truth top and associated children for the hadronic decay mode.
   The plot is partitioned into the particle symbols.

Figure 2.d
----------
.. figure:: ./figures/Figure.2.d.png
   :align: center
   :name: Figure.2.mc20.d

   A histogram plot of the :math:`\Delta R` for all possible truth children pair permutations.
   The plot is partitioned into whether the truth children originated from a mutual top or if there was a cross over.

============

A set of specific studies relating to Elise's resonance reconstruction algorithm in the Same Sign Dilepton Channel.
The reconstruction algorithm leverages the double neutrino reconstruction algorithm and uses a static top mass to select the neutrino solution which minimizes the difference between measured top-quark mass and predicted.

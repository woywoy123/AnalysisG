## Glossary:
- **Truth Tops**: 
Tops-Quarks within the sample which have already emitted gluons (Final State Radiation).
- **Truth Top Children (Truth Children)**: 
Particles originating from the Truth Tops, if any of the particles are a W-Boson, then its children are used.
- **Truth Jets**: 
Partons after they undergo hadronization without any detector convolutions. 
- **Jets**:
Partons after they undergo hadronization with detector convolutions.
- **Signal/Resonance Tops**:
Top-Quarks produced from the Z/H Beyond Standard Model Particle.
- **Spectator Tops**
Tops-Quarks which are the by-product of producing a Z/H boson.

## Studies: 
- **ZPrimeMatrix**: 
This study creates a 2D plot of the PT vs Mass of the Z/H-Resonance for tops, truth children, truth jets and jets.
- **ResonanceDecayModes**:
Provides information about how the tops involved in the resonance decay. 
- **ResonanceMassFromTops**: 
Reconstructs the signal resonance from truth tops after Final State Radiation. 
- **ResonanceDeltaRTops**:
Aims to identify shape differences between spectator and signal tops using deltaR distributions.
- **ResonanceTopKinematics**:
Depicts the various kinematics of the spectator/signal tops being produced from the signal Z/H-Resonance.
- **EventNTruthJetAndJets**:
This study aims to identify the loss in truth jets by having off-diagonal elements in a 2D plot. 
It also explores the MET vs n-Lepton correlations.
- **EventMETImbalance**:
A set of plots which explore the missing transverse discrepancy between measurement from the detector simulation and the truth neutrinos.
- **EventNuNuSolutions**:
This study aims to investigate the number of double neutrino solutions obtained when rotating the 4-top system such that, the z-component of the 4-vector points down the beam-pipe.
The number of solutions obtained after rotation is compared to a non-rotation operation.
Only events containing exactly two neutrinos and b-quarks originating from two truth tops are considered, regardless of whether these originate from the resonance.
- **TopDecayModes**:
Plots indicating to which children the Top-Quark decays into. 
- **ResonanceMassFromChildren**:
Plots relating to the resonance being reconstructed from the top truth children, where the resonance tops decay either Hadronically, Leptonically or Hadronically-Leptonically.
- **TruthChildrenKinematics**:
This selection implementation aims to investigate the delta-R dependency of the parent top PT and how closely clustered the children are together. 


## Figures Produced:
### ZPrimeMatrix:
- **ZPrimeMatrix-TruthTops**: 
A 2D figure depicating the Z/H transverse momenta as a function of invariant mass from truth tops.
- **ZPrimeMatrix-TruthChildren**: 
A 2D figure depicting the Z/H transverse momenta as a function of invariant mass from truth children.

A 2D figure depicting the Z/H transverse momenta as a function of invariant mass from truth jets.
- **ZPrimeMatrix-Jets**: 
A 2D figure depicting the Z/H transverse momenta as a function of invariant mass from jets.

### ResonanceDecayModes:
- **Figure_1.1a**:
Number of hadronic and leptonically decaying resonance tops (a resonance is classified as hadronic if all tops decay hadronically)
- **Figure_1.1b**:
Decay channels of the tops, this is an extension of Figure 1.1a.

### ResonanceMassFromTops:
- **Figure_1.1c**:
Split into whether the children tops decay leptonically and hadronically or both (Top decay channel shouldn't impact the mass, but just to be sure)

### ResonanceDeltaRTops:
- **Figure_1.1d**:
DeltaR between process truth tops  (Here we check whether the spectator tops are separated from resonance tops)

### ResonanceTopKinematics:
- **Figure_1.1e**:
PT Distribution of tops 
- **Figure_1.1f**:
Energy Distribution of tops
- **Figure_1.1g**:
Pseudorapidity of tops 
- **Figure_1.1h**:
Azimuthal angle of tops

### EventNTruthJetAndJets:
- **N-TruthJets_n-Jets**:
A plot, depicting on a per event basis, the number of truth jets vs reconstructed jets (i.e. observed jets).
Ideally, this would be as diagonal as possible to indicate no truth jet loss
- **MissingET_n-TruthLep**:
A plot illustrating how the number of leptonically decaying tops contribute to the missing transverse momenta of the event.

### EventMETImbalance:
- **4-TopSystem-Pz_PT**:
A 2D plot illustrating non-zero PT components from the 4-top system. 
This is due to the samples not capturing the partons originating from the colliding protons. 
- **AngleRelativeToBeamPipe**:
The angle between the Pz component and the PT of the 4-top system. 
Ideally, a strong clustering around the 0-rad mark should be observed, anything else is indicating that not all the MET can be accounted for by only looking at truth neutrinos.
- **AngleRelativeToBeamPipe-Rotated**:
The angle between the Pz component and the PT of the 4-top system, after rotating the system according to the imbalance angle.
This plot is majorly a closure test to assure the rotation was implemented correctly and should yield a peak at 0.
- **MissingET**:
A plot illustrating the distributions of the Missing Energy in the Transverse direction as measured in simulation and reconstructed from Truth Neutrinos.
- **difference-MissingET**:
The observed difference between measurement and truth neutrinos.
- **MissingET-Rotated**:
A plot illustrating the distribution of the missing Energy in the Transverse direction as measured in simulation, but with the truth neutrinos being rotated into a reference frame where the 4-top system momentum balance is zero.
- **difference-MissingET-Rotated**:
The observed difference between measurement and rotated truth neutrinos.

### EventNuNuSolutions:
- **Number-of-solutions**:
Number of returned neutrino solutions with and without rotation of the 4-top system.



### TopDecayModes:
- **Figure_2.1a**:
A plot depicting the fraction by which the Top-Quark decays into. 
- **Figure_2.1b**:
A plot of the reconstructed invariant mass of the tops from their corresponding truth children.

### ResonanceMassFromChildren:
- **Figure_2.1c**:
A plot of the reconstructed resonance from truth children.

### TruthChildrenKinematics:
- **Figure_2.1d**:
A plot illustrating the delta-R between truth children originating from a common top, but partitioned into resonance/spectator tops.
- **Figure_2.1e**:
A plot illustrating the delta-R between originating truth top and decay children partitioned into leptonic and hadronic top decay channels.
- **Figure_2.1f**:
A plot illustrating the overlap in delta-R between truth children originating and not originating from mutual top. 
This aims to identify whether only using the delta-R to cluster children causes falsely matched children.
From the legend, 'False' implies the parent tops are not equal.
- **Figure_2.1g**:
A TH2F plot of the originating top's PT and only hadronically decaying top children delta-R. 
This aims to verify whether a correlation between the top's PT and the clustering of children is present. 
- **Figure_2.1h**:
A TH2F plot of the originating top's PT and only Leptonically decaying top children delta-R. 
This aims to verify whether a correlation between the top's PT and the clustering of children is present. 
- **Figure_2.1i**:
A plot illustrating the fractional PT being transferred to truth children from associated top.

a: PDGID of Truth Jet parton contributions - These are derived from the GhostPartons that define the truth jet
b: Fraction of parton PT contribution to truth jet
c: DeltaR between parton contributions and truth jet axis
d: Truth Jet PT classified into from top or background
e: Inefficiency of truth jet parton matching based on truth child PDGID (This is based on the truth partons contained in the truth jet.). 
- To elaborate further what this plot tries to demonstrate, it is the percentage lost of each child type. 
- This is calculated by counting the respective top child pdgid and taking the ratio when using truth jet partons matched to the top child. 
- For example; (truth) t -> b + q + qbar this should yield in an ideal world 1 b and 2 q's but from the truth jet partons, this list might only contain b + q, meaning all 'b' were collected, but one of the q's has been lost. 
- A plot of this would therefore have b (0%) and q (50%) (due to the lost qbar). 
f: Reconstructed Invariant Top Mass from Truth Jets - Split into Lepton (+ using the neutrino from truth children - Just to double check that the jets are consistent) and hadronic
g: Z-Prime from Had-Had, Had-Lep, Lep-Lep (again including neutrino)

h: Counting merged truth jets from Signal and Spectator tops. 
i: DeltaR Distribution between truth jets originating from the same truth top. This assumed NO Truth Jets shared different tops.
j: DeltaR Distribution between truth jets originating from different truth tops. This assumed NO Truth Jets shared different tops.


#-----\/ --- needs reworking
-> Figure 4: (x) Not Complete yet.... Jets
+Do as above but add deltaR between jet and truth jet 

-> Figure 5: (x) Not Complete yet....
+ Do Bruce Analysis.
+ Selection criteria:
~> Leptonic t: This is spectator 1
~> 2 Hardest b-tagged jets: these correspond to the Z' daughter tops
~> attach two other jets to each <somehow> (I use deltaR)
~> You now have the Z' -> ttbar daughters
~> Remaining jets are your 2nd spectators 
~> Form M(Z')
~> Fit fit M(Z')
